\section{Motivation} \label{subsection:introduction-motivation}
Licensing is also present in Android.
With a market share of almost 82.8\% in Q2 of 2015 \cite{androidShare} it is the most used mobile \gls{os}.
According to Google, this market share translates to over 1.4 billion active devices in the last 30 days in September 2015 \cite{androidDevices}.
This giant number of Android devices is powered by Google Play \cite{googlePlay}.
Google's marketplace offers different kinds of digital goods, as applications, music or movies, but also hardware.
In the application section of Google Play user can chose from over 1.6 million applications for Android \cite{statistaAppStore}.
In 2014 Google's marketplace overtook Apple's Appstore, which had a revenue of over 10 billion back in 2013, and became the biggest application store on a mobile platform \cite{wiwoValue}.
\newline
The growth comes with advantages.
Some time ago developers only considered iOS as a profitable platform and thus most applications were developed for Apple's \gls{os} only or at least first.
Now, with Android's overwhelming market share, they focus heavily on Android \cite{businessProfit}.
But this also creates a downside.
The expanding market for Android, offering many high quality applications, draws the attention of software pirates.
Crackers do not only bypass application's license mechanisms and offer them for free.
Redirecting cash flows or distributing malware using plagiates is an lucrative business model as well.
\newline
Android developers are aware of the situation \cite{developersPiracy} and express their need to protect their \gls{ip} on platforms like xda-developers \cite{xdaPiracy} or stackoverflow \cite{stackoverflowPiracy}.
Many of the developers have problems with the license verification mechanism and name \textit{Lucky Patcher} as one of their biggest problems \cite{stackoverflowLucky}.

\newline
The scope of this thesis is to analyse Android cracking applications, like Lucky Patcher, and to investigate in countermeasures for developers.
