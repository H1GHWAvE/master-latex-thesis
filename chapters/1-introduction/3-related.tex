Patrick Bernhard takes a look at license verification an in-app billing attacks in his master's thesis \textit{A Security Analysis of Apps for Android Lollipop and Possible Countermeasures against Resulting Attacks}.
He comes to the conclusion that the libraries need an overhaul since they are easy to circumvent and have not been updated for a long time.
This shows the urgency on further investigation on this topic.

Marius-Nicolae Muntean's master's thesis \textit{Improving License Verification in Android} presents an analysis of techniques to crack Android's license verification and implements a new approach.
He introduces multiple general strategies, such as obfuscation and dynamic code generation, to fortify code.
In the end he uses the insights from the analysis to suggest countermeasures and their effects.
A similar approach is chosen for this thesis.
