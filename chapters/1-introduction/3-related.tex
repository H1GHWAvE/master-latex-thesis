Since piracy on Android is a serious topic, there has been research in this field already.

The Master's Theses of Patrick Bernhard \cite{bernhardSecurity} and Marius-Nicolae Muntean \cite{kovachevaMaster} both analysed attacks on different license verification libraries.
This included the solutions of Amazon, Google and Xamarin.
The authors give an overview of possible solutions to protect the application by using techniques like obfuscation.

A step further is the Master's Thesis of Alexandrina Kovacheva. She evaluates applications from the store for their protection mechanisms and then suggests an implementation of an bytecode obfuscator.
