%\section{Licensing} \label{section:introduction-licensing}
Software Licensing is the legally binding agreement between two parties regarding the purchase, installation and use of software according to its terms of use.
It defines the rights of the licensor and the licensee.
On the one hand, the goal is to protect the software creator's \gls{ip} or other features and enable him to commercialize it as a product.
On the other hand it defines the boundaries for the user and prevents him from illicit usage \cite{uncgLicensing}.
\newline
\newline
Since licensing software often includes fees, these products often have mechanisms implemented to enforce the legal agreement and to prevent unauthorized use.
The solutions range from providing limited features or usage for a limited time to disabling the software in case no legit account or serial key is provided.
\newline
\newline
But as long as there have been these protection mechanisms there have been software pirates who tried to circumvent it. It is an everlasting arms race\cite{szCopy}.
