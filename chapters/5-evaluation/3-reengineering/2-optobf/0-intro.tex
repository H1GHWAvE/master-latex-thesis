in practice quite limited due to:
reliance on android framework apis (remain unobfuscated)
jdwp and application debuggability at the java lvl
if dalvik can execute it, so can a proper analysis tool (e.g. IDA, dextra)
popular enough obfuscators (dexguard) have deobfuscators
this is why JNI is so popular
