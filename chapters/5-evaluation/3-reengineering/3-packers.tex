\subsection{Packers}
\label{subsection:evaluation-reengineering-packers}
since luckypatcher 
at the moment there is no commercial packer available for public right now
so this is just an idea to start with

only a proof of concept, e.g. uses simple encryption methods, but the idea can be extended, needs knowledge and time
if implemented in a good way it protect from static analysis, in case the decryption cannot be broken the analysis has to be after the stub loads the decrypted dex file into the memory since it has to be loaded here to be executed, no real protection from reading directly from the memory
when applied to many small parts with different stubs it can make the analysis even harder

for HoseDex2Jar there is already a depacker \cite{githubDehoser}
