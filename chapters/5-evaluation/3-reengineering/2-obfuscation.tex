\subsection{Obufscation}
\label{subsection:evaluation-reengineering-optobf}

EVAULATIOn
in practice quite limited due to:
reliance on android framework apis (remain unobfuscated)
jdwp and application debuggability at the java lvl
if dalvik can execute it, so can a proper analysis tool (e.g. IDA, dextra)
popular enough obfuscators (dexguard) have deobfuscators
this is why JNI is so popular

dexguard EVALUATION:  dynamic analysis beats this and read directly from memory
