\section{Tampering Protection} \label{section:evaluation-tampering}
all tampering counter measurements have kind of the same pattern, boolean check, simple method == simple fix, can be nulled easily when code is known, just as easy to crack as LVL when you know the code, but attackr has to invest some time to understand code and to build counter measurement, in addition with Section~\ref{section:evaluation-reengineering} this can get annoying, evtl create native versions because harder to crack
even though it is simple it adds a little bit extra work to attack and when cobined this grows exponential

but be careful because
annoy people who want to use root
annoy people who bought the app but have luckypatcher/root as well
