take away:
dex is dangerous executable format
risks to app developers are significant with no clear solutions

zu ART.
dex isnt dead yet, even with art
still buried deep inside those oat files
far easier to reverse engineer embedded dex than do so for oat

art is a far more advanced runtime architecture, brings android closer to ios native level performance
vestiges of dex still remain to haunt performance, dex code is still 32bit
very much still a shifting landscape, internal structures keep on changing, google isnt afraid to break compatibility, llvm integration likely to only increas eand improve
for most users the change is smooth, better performance and power consumption, negligible cost binary size increase, minor limitations on dex obfuscation remain, for optimal performance and obfuscation nothing beats JNI
