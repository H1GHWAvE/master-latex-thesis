until lvl see major update custom improvements have to be done

Den user sich was überlegen lassen ist nur zu einem gewissen maße nützlich, google muss etwas allgemeines erfinden

ART
Improve ART, \gls{apk} still dex, dex also inside ART, move to compiled machine code, harter to debug and modify
art promising but not root issue, dex is distributed and art compilation to native on device
needs to become relevant so developers can release art only apps, native code and no issue with reverse engineering stop/less important
\cite{andevconDalvikART}

SE
se/tee muss es eine lösung geben sonst braucht man für verschiedene apps verscheidene se, gemeinsame kraft um die eine lösung zu verbessern und nicht lauter schweizer käse zu ahben
google hat schon sowas wie google vault

TRUSTY TEE
Although the Trusty OS enables the development of new applications, doing so must be exercised with extreme care; each new application increases the area of the trusted computing base (TCB) of the system. Trusted applications can access device secrets and can perform computations or data transformations using them.\cite{trusty} \cite{teeGlobal}
The ability to develop new applications that run in the TEE opens up many possibilities for innovation. However, due to the very definition of TEE, these applications cannot be distributed without some form of trust attached. Typically this comes in the form of a digital signature by an entity trusted by the user of the product on which the application runs.



Generell kann man von der malware lernen
all papers with malware and copyright protection is interesting since they also want to hide their code
