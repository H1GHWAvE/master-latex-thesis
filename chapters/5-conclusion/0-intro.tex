This thesis analysis the \gls{luckypatcherg} and its attacks on the different license verification libraries.
Android's open architecture allows the user to extract and install applications from any sources.
The freedom comes at the price that \gls{luckypatcherg} can modify \gls{apk}s even without root permission.
This puts the unchanged implementation of license verification libraries at risk of being voided.
\newline
Google is aware of the situation but cannot do more than to motivate the developers to make their library implementation unique.
