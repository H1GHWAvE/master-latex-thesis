\section{Analysis of Patched Applications} \label{section:luckypatcher-operation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item code analysis nto successful, analyse modified applications
  \item find attack points by using different apps and patching modes
  \item analysis with tools explained before
  \item use apks not odex since odex may be optimized
  \item goal is to see changes on different levels, dex, smali, java with diff
  \item start with reference application to ahve full control, lvl, samsung, amazon
  \item also on different apps to have a variety
  \item A pattern is a set of predefined sequences of bytecode in which a certain values are modified.
  \item execute all modes to identify all patterns
  \item explain modes as described in LP
\end{itemize}
