reason lucky ptcher is taken exremely popular and easy(no technical knowdlege except root but apps can be traded)

main goal is to circumvent license verification, app should behave as it is legally aquired in app store, by user hence work normally, full features

most common way client-server license verification, app gathers info and sends to server, server checks info and depending on this sends response, finally app acts according to response code

since server is not accessible and man-in-the-middle has to break encryption, like spoofing, which is difficult (encryption in general), has to work in application

effective, popular, vielseitig (viel internet -see- quelle)
high damage potential since popular, automated and general use by non professional
