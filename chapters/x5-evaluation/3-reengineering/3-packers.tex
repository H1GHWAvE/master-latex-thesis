\subsection{Packers}
\label{subsection:evaluation-reengineering-packers}
this is very effective against luckypatcher since the code luckypatcher wants to access is encrypted and thus it cannot change anything without dencrypting it

even though hosedex2jar e.g. is only a proof of concept and not available anymore, it is a good point to start with the build of an own packer
it only uses simple encryption methods but this is already sufficient for luckypatcher to be defunct
either a custom patch which works on encrypted dex or a modus which first decrypts the dex, aptches it and enctypts it again  has to introduced
needs keys for this thus has to be fully analyzed and know the keys
this can be prevented by the stub verifying when loading the dex

in general idea can be extended since it causes trouble for luckypatcher, but needs knowledge and time
also if implemented in a good way it protect from reengineering in general as long as it is not cracked, e.g. for HoseDex2Jar there is already a depacker \cite{githubDehoser}, can be circumvented automatically then

reengineering is not that difficult since the decrypted dex can be read from the memory and there is no protection from it

when applied to many small parts with different stubs it can make the analysis even harder
