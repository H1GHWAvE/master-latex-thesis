this tries to directly encounter luckypatcher by fighting the way the patterns work

it is easy to apply and there are no limits of variants how it can be modified
luckypatcher has to look at each app individual and in the worst case create custom patches
but as it seams developers do not like to modify as seen in analysis since all apps are somehow patchable
