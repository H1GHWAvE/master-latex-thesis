\subsection{Content Encryption} \label{subsection:counter-replace-encryption}
Encryption is introduced as part of content based countermeasure.
The content driven approach relies on content being provided by a server.
This can be done unencrypted under the condition the user is verified, or encrypted where only verified users get the proper key.
This key has to be protected against theft.
