Encryption is introduced as a countermeasure to prevent piracy of content.
It has two advantages in the fight against cracking applications since it is more complex.
The first advantage is that the cryptographic keys are not predictable.
\gls{luckypatcherg} is not able to patch the application in a way that a certain outcome is enforced.
The second advantage is that the application does not work in the way it is intended when the decryption key is not present or the decryption methods are patched.
