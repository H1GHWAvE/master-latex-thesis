Now that that the methodology of Lucky Patcher is analyzed, improvements to prevent the it from circumventing the license check mechanism can be proposed.
The first chapter will cover methods to improve the current implementation of the \gls{lvl}, additional integrity tests to detect tampering and options to make the code more resistant against attacks.
\newline
The second chapter proposes ways to make the the unary outcome when the license is verified more complex by introducing a content server and encryption.
\newline
The third chapter takes a look at \gls{art} and \gls{tee} as environmental improvements to tackle this issue.
