Application developers are interested in protecting their applications. Protection in this case means that it should be hard to understand
what an application is doing and how its functionalities are implemented.\newline


Reverse engineering of Android applications is much easier than on other architectures -> high level but simple bytecode language\newline

Obfuscation techniques protect intellectual property of software/license verification\newline

possible code obfuscation methods on the Android platform focus on obfuscating Dalvik bytecode -> limitations of current reverse engineering tools\newline
