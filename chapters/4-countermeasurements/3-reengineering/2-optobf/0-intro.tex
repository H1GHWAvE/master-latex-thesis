(a) at source code and (b) bytecode level, Most existing open-source and commercial tools work on source code level\newline
Java code is architecture-independent giving freedom to design generic code transformations. Lowering the obfuscation level to bytecode requires the algorithms applied to be tuned accordingly to the underlying architecture\newline

a few dex obfuscators exist, with different approaches
proguard or sdex, rename methods, field and calss names -- break down string operations so as to chop hard coded strings or encrypt -- can use dynamic class loading (dexloader classes to impede static analysis)
can add dead code and dummy lopps (minor impact of performance)
can also use goto into other onstructions

in practice quite limited due to:
reliance on android framework apis (remain unobfuscated)
jdwp and application debuggability at the java lvl
if dalvik can execute it, so can a proper analysis tool (e.g. IDA, dextra)
popular enough obfuscators (dexguard) have deobfuscators
this is why JNI is so popular

Obfuscators/Optimizors definition\newline
Obfuscation techniques are used to protect software and the implemented algorithms\newline
designed to make reverse engineering harder and more time consuming, hin und her zwischen obfuscation und reverse engineering techniken\newline
obfuscation techniques must not alter the behavior of programs, often only target specific reverse engineering steps, few general protection schemes, possible slower execution, not topic here, just examples for obfuscation applications

remove dead/debug code\newline
potentially encrypt/obfuscate/hide via reflection\newline

definition obfuscation, was macht es, wie funktioniert es, wer hat es erfunden, wie wendet man es an\newline

"hard to reverse engineer" but without changing the behavior of this
application, was heißt hardto reverse\newline

parallele zu disassembler ziehen\newline

Obfuscation cannot prevent reverse engineering but can make it harder and more time consuming. We will discuss which obfuscation and code protection methods are applicable under Android and show limitations of current reverse engineering tools\newline

The following optimizers/obfuscators are common tools. (dadrin dann verbreitung preis etc erklären)
