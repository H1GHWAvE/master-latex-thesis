PoC packer\newline
not available for real use\newline
appears defunct\newline
near zero ITW samples\newline
mimics dexception attack from dex education 101\newline
FUNCTION\newline
encrypts and injects dexfile into dex header (deception)\newline
very easy to spot\newline
very easy to decrypt, just use dex2jar\newline
static analysis does not work since it sees the encrypted file\newline
on execution loader stub decrypts in memory and dumps to file system\newline
loader stub acts as proxy and passes events to the dex file on system using a dexClassLoader\newline
RESULT\newline
simple PoC\newline
slight file size increase\newline
attempts to prevent static analysis - kind of works\newline
lots of crashing\newline
easily automated to unpack\newline
easy to reverse, good for learning\newline
hacker protection factor 0.5
