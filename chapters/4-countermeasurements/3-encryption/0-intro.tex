A part of the license verification's insecurity is the fact that not only the possible outcome is binary, either the license is verified or it is not, but it is also possible to predict the outcome since in the end, only one result is accepted.
This mechanism can be easily attacked.
The attacker can modify that even the wrong result is always accepted.
\newline
In order to fight this major flaw, encryption is introduced to extend the original license verification.
The advantage of encryption is the unpredictable outcome of an input which is not spoofable anymore compared to the binary check.
Before taking advantage of encryption, it has to be decided what content should be encrypted and where the key should be stored.
