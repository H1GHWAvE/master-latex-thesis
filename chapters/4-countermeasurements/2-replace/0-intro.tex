A part of the license verification's insecurity is the fact that not only the possible outcome is binary, either the license is verified or it is not, but it is also possible to predict the outcome since in the end, only one result is accepted.
This mechanism can be easily attacked.
The attacker can modify that even the wrong result is always accepted.
\newline
In order to fight this major flaw, more complex mechanisms have to replace the original license verification.
In the following, different approaches are proposed.
The first proposal is the introduction of content server which allows to move part of the functionality, like the license verification, from the application to a server.
The server cannot be attacked by the cracking application and thus is safe.
\newline
The second proposal is to introduce encryption.
Encryption enables unpredictable outcomes instead of binary ones.
