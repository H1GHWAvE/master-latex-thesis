\begin{itemize}
  \item big vulnerability is binary outcome,predictable, can be forced unary and
  \item wrong result will be accepted
  \item improve this flaw by introducing complex mechanism and replace old
  \item two proposals: content server with verification on server to counter modification, encryption to make outcome unpredictable
\end{itemize}

In order to fight this major flaw, more complex mechanisms have to replace the original license verification.
In the following, different approaches are proposed.
The first proposal is the introduction of content server which allows to move part of the functionality, like the license verification, from the application to a server.
The server cannot be attacked by the cracking application and thus is safe.
\newline
The second proposal is to introduce encryption.
Encryption enables unpredictable outcomes instead of binary ones.
