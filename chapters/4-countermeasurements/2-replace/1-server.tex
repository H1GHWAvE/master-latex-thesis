By introducing service managed account, the user has to login on a server in order for the application to work
an example is spotify, where the user logs in on a server and then can stream music
without account it is not possible to obtain the stream details and even though when the stream details are obtained they can be encrypted with a user specific key the attacker does not have
this way also an awesome algorithm can be moved onto the server that the application is only a thin client, this way reverse engineering or pirating does not offer any value to the attacker
