\subsubsection{Action Obfuscator} \label{subsubsectionection:counter-replace-encryption-content-obfuscator}
The second approach is using encryption as a kind of obfuscation.
The idea is to have a method, which is called by each method, to deligate all calls according to an encrypted parameter.
The attacker can try to guess which method call is linked to each method, but when additional encryption for the parameters is applied and decryption is used in the target method, it is very hard to crack the logic without modifying a lot of code.
The encryption can combined with additional manipulation of the objects in order to make the simple removing of encryption not enough.
This methodology is most effective on non boolean objects.
An abstract presentation of the mechanism can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:encryptionAction}.
