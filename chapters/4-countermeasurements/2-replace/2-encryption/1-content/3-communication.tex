\subsubsection{Communication Decryption} \label{section:counter-replace-encryption-content-communication}
The third approach is to use encryption on the server response.
This is an additional security feature which is applied in combination with a content server described in subsection~\ref{section:counter-replace-server}.
When the user does the login on the server, additional unique device specific paramters have be passed as well.
The server generates a cryptographic key which is used for communication is encrypted

combined with device specific key, accounts cannot be shared anymore (either hacked or shared libratly)
