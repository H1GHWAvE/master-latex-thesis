best would be to have a security mechanism lucky patcher cannot access, since until now every android version could be rooted using an exploit thus very likely that it will be possible in the future as well
all data thus can be accessed by the user
in order to achieve secure storage introduce secure elements for critical code like license verification
secure space separated from the devecide and its restrictions and vulnerabilities\cite{kannengie√üerProposal}


can either be mounted in the sdcard slot or using an adapter for the usb interface
accessed over reads and writes to the filesystem
since it has to be small as a sd card and powered by the host system its hardware capabilities are restrained as well \cite{stSe} with power as low as 25MHz complexe calculations would take too much time

can be used to prevent static analysis
encrypted stgrings from the application can be decrypted by the secure element
