son of proguard, does everything that proguard does
its a optimizer and shrinekr, obfuscator/encrypter, does not stop reverse engineering
automatic reflection, string encryption, asset/library encryption, class encryption(packing), applciation tamper protection, removes debug information
may increase dex size, memory size; decrease speed
\cite{strazzareLevel0}

obfuscation methods are a superset of ProGuards
more powerful but also does not protect from disassembling the code

protects apps from reverse engineering and ahckign attacks
makes apps smaller and faster
specialized fr android
protects code: obfuscation, hides sensitive strings,keys and entire algorithms
