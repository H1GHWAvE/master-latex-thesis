\textit{DexGuard} is a commercial Android obfuscator for Java code.
It is considered the son of \textit{ProGuard} and specialized on Android.
The provided methods are a super set of \textit{ProGuard}'s ones. \cite{strazzareLevel0}

In addition to the obfuscation, \textit{DexGuard} offers application and platform integrity, resource protection, communication hardening and code protection \cite{dexguard}.
This way, the application is not only fortified against code analysis but also steps against the reverse engineering itself are applied.
