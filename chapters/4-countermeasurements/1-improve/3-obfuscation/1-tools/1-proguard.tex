\subsubsection{Proguard} \label{subsection:counter-obfuscation-solution-proguard}
The most basic obfuscation tool is \textit{ProGuard}.
It is an open-source Java obfuscator which is part of the Android \gls{sdk} and free of charge.
\newline
\textit{ProGuards}'s
feature set includes identifier obfuscation for packages, classes, methods, and fields
was kann er noch? -see- Besides these protection mechanisms it can also
identify and highlight dead code and removed in a second, manual step
Unused classes removed automatically by ProGuard.
easy integration




removes unused classes, fields, methods and attributes which got past javac
shrinks, optimizes and obfuscates java .class files
optimization step methods are inlined, unused parameters removed, classes and methods made private/static/final as possible
optimizes, shrinks, (barely) obfuscates, , reduces size, faster
removes unnecessary/unused code
variable identifiers name scrambling for packages,classes, methods and fields
obfuscation step name and identifiers mangled, data obfuscation is performed, packages flattened, methods renamed to same name and overloading differentiates them
lexical-sorted strings like {a, b, c, ..., aa, ab}, original identifiers give information about interesting parts of a program
merges identical code blocks
performs optimiztations
removes debug information
renames objects
restructures code
removes linenumbers, stacktrace annoying

string obfuscationa, string must be available at runtime because a user cannot
understand an obfuscated or encrypted message dialog, deobfuscation stub

shrinks the code size by automatically removing unused classes, detects and highlights dead code, but leaves the developer to remove it manually

advantage of minimizing the memory usage, e development process in step ”a” or step ”b” \newline
- smaller apk files (use rprofits download and less space)
- obfuscated code, especially layout obfuscation, harder to reverse engineer
- small performance increase due to optimizations

integrated into android build system, thus easy use
