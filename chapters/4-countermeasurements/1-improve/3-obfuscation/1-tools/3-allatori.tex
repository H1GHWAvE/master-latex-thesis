\subsubsection{Allatori} \label{subsection:counter-obfuscation-solution-allatori}
\textit{Allatori} is acommercial Android obfuscator from Smardec.
Similar to \textit{DexGuard} it provides a superset of \textit{ProGuard}'s methods. \cite{allatori}
\newline
The features of \textit{Allatori} include name obfuscation, string encryption and debug information obfuscation.
Even flattening of the structure and obfuscationof the control flow are possible.
Another feature is the addition of complexity to algorithms, e.g. loops are modified in a way that reverse engineering tool do not recognize them as such.

\newline
Overall, the resulting application has a decreased \gls{dex} file and memory footprint while having increased speed.
