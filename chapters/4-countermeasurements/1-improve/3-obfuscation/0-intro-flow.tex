\begin{itemize}
  \item modification prevents automatic patching, manual analysis and custom patches still possible
  \item use obfuscation to make reengineering harder and time consuming, does not offer total protection
  \item helps since attacker has to understand what happens in order to fix it, obfuscation removes names so understanding is harder
  \item  applied when compiling
  \item definition obfuscation
  \item can be applied everywhere without much extra workload
  \item does not prevent automatic patching or alters flow
  \item removes symbols that reveal information
  \item can be applied to soruce code or bytecode, bytecode needs advanced algorithms
  \item  number of commercial and open-source obfuscators from java
  \item different dex obfuscators
  \item some emthods cannot be obfuscated since they need to communicate with the android frmework
  \item does not protect directly against LP but helps versus attacks on customized libraries
\end{itemize}
