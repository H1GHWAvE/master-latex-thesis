The first action against Lucky Patcher is to actively improve the spot its attacking which was identified and presented in figure~\ref{fig:verificationNowAttack}.
The goal is to prevent the automatical application of patching patterns as well as the execution in case tampering was detected.
Since these checks can be voided after analysing the code manually and adding them to the patching procedure, obfuscation is introduced as a tool to make reverse engineering more complex.
