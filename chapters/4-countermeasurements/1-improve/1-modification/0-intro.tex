a determined attacker willing to disassemble and reassemble code can eventully hack around the service
developer can make hackers task immensely more difficult to the point where it is not worth the time

lvl protects against casual piracy, users who try to copy apks directly from one device to another without purcahsing the applciation

modify to make difficult to apply common cracking techniques.

amazon/samsung not much to do since from company that is why the following not simple methods target lvl

patching application code is both most wide-spread and most powerful to interfer app logic
ease is unfortunate for android developers, need better methods to protect vulnerable/precious code from attacks
adding additional layer of security, making it a little ahrder for attackers

CHARAKTERIZED IN DIFFERENT TYPES, tampering protection to detect attack, modifications to enforce additional work in order to crack, methods directly targeting reengineering and additional external features, can be stacked
