Attacking with \gls{luckypatcherg} is often successful because many developers do not customize the \gls{lvl} at all.
One reason for not customizing the \gls{lvl} is that protection against casual piracy is sufficient for the developer.
Casual piracy is the copying of \gls{apk}s from one device to another by uninformed users.

Another reason is that they do not know where exactly to fortify the library and thus they do not want to spend additional effort \cite{developersSecuring}.

This thesis presents two approaches to fortify an application against attacks by \gls{luckypatcherg}.
\newline
The first approach is to actively go against \gls{luckypatcherg}'s patterns by modifying the identified parts of code.
\newline
The second approach is to implement the \gls{lvl} with native code which is not targeted by \gls{luckypatcherg}'s auto patching modes.
\newline
While the idea of the approaches is valid for all license verification libraries, the implementation is only possible for the \gls{lvl}.
It requires access to the source code, which is available for the \gls{lvl}, as opposed to Samsung's and Amazon's libraries.
