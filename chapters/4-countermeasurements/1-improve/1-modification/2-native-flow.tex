\subsection{Native Implementation of \gls{lvl}} \label{subsection:counter-modifications-dynamic}
\begin{itemize}
  \item LP automatic mode attacks dex code
  \item android supports native code, implement lvl in native code
  \item usually for cpu heavy tasks, increased complexity, desired when lvl, harder to understand and to decompile
  \item two scenarios, implemented by developer and by google
  \item developer: unique but requires knowledge, skill and time
  \item attackers have to invest more time to analyse since native code and unique, costs a lot of time, scares off attackers, but iof cracked it can be provided as custom patch
  \item google: if native, harder to find vulnerabilities since code more complex
  \item take some time to crack but motivation since all apps would use it, provide as custom patch
  \item to counter this: heavy obfuscation, encryption, dynamic code generation, use all what possible to make as ahrd as possible to crack
  \item good idea, but hard to implement as noone has done it yet, but first steps to address vulnerabilities of dex have been done with art

\item in general: can also be cracked and provided as custom patches, but more time has to be spend since analysis is more difficult, but luckypatcher already contains custom patches so people do it
\end{itemize}
