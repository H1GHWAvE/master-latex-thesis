\subsection{Native Implementation} \label{subsection:counter-modifications-dynamic}
\gls{luckypatcherg}'s automatic patching modes, as described in chapter~\ref{chapter:luckypatcher}, target the application's bytecode inside the \textit{classes.dex}.
Since Android supports the \gls{ndk}, parts of the application can be implemented using native code.
\newline
Usually the \gls{ndk} targets CPU intensive taks, such as game engines and signal processing, but it can be used for any other purposes as well.
Google suggests using it only if necessary since it increases the complexity of an application \cite{androidNdk}.
This is a desired side effect when implementing the \gls{lvl} natively.
Native code, in opposite of byte-code, does not contain much meta-data, such as local variable types or class structure.
Its information is discared on compilation and thus the code is harder to understand.
\newline
There are two scenarios for creating a native implementation of the \gls{lvl}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The developers creates his own version of native implementation
  \item Google provides a native implementation of the \gls{lvl}
\end{itemize}
When the developer creates his own implementation of the \gls{lvl} it is unique.
In order to achieve this, the developer needs the required knowledge and skill as well as time to implement it.
In case the implementation is done in a right way, it offers uniqueness and safety.
The attackers have to invest time to analyse the native code of the license verification and the implementation into the application itself.
Only after reverse engineering the native code, they can start with searching for a way to break the license verification mechanism, repack the native code and make it available as a custom patch for \gls{luckypatcherg}.
This scares off attackers since the circumventing of the license verification requires a lot of knowledge and time.
As long as the attacker is evaluating the workload with the gain of cracking the application, it is considered a safe method, implied the developer has enough available resouces. \cite{munteanLicense}
\newline
Instead of providing Java code, Google could provide a native version of the \gls{lvl}.
In the beginnign, it would be harder to find vulnerabilities than it was with the Java version.
It would take some time for the attackers to crack the library but it would be justified for the attackers since the library would be implemented into all Play Store applications.
Now this license verification would face the same probles as Amazon's or Samsung's libraries since one custom patch applied by \gls{luckypatcherg} would be able to crack all applications.
For this reason, the implementation should include two essential features.
\begin{itemize}
\item heavy obfuscation should be applied since users do not need to understand the library
\item encryption, dynamic code generation and automatic customization everytime it is loaded, since having only one version is an easy target
\end{itemize}
In addition to making the license check native, parts of the application should be moved into the native code.
This protects against attacks where the call of the license verification library is skipped.
\newline
In general, the proposal is simple, but the implementation is much harder.
Until now, no big companie has come up with such approach.
This indicates that still a lot of reseach and work has to be done to implement this solution.
At least, first steps in this direction have be made by addressing dex and its vulnerabilities. \cite{munteanLicense}
\newline
As long as the the license verification library is implemented in native code, the automatic patching modes of \gls{luckypatcherg} do not work.
Attackers have to analyse the native code and create a custom patch for the application.
These custom patches can already be found for some applications in form of modified \textit{.so} files.
