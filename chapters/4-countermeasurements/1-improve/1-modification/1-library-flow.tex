\subsubsection{Modify the Library} \label{subsection:counter-modifications-library}
\begin{itemize}
  \item LP relies on patterns applied to interfer logic
  \item solution: prevent to apply patterns, opnly possible when code can be modified (lvl), more difficult for amaozn and samsung
  \item modification also increases complexity and thus harder to reverse
  \item three locations:
  \item core licensing library logic
  \item entry andexit points of the licensing library
  \item invocation and handling of the response
  \item Ideas for each
\end{itemize}
