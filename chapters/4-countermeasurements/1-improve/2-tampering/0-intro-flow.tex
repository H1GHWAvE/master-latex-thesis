\begin{itemize}
    \item check environment for integrity
    \item integrity broken when app is cracked, unless very precisely done
    \item can be detected and implemented as additional checks, prevent app from running
    \item can be circumvented with patching as well, but attacker has to know that they exist and where they implemented in order to patch them
    \item obfuscation and spreading helps, or native implementation
    \item does not rpevent LP from working but adds another layer of security
