\subsubsection{Signature} \label{subsection:counter-improve-tampering-signature}
\begin{itemize}
  \item when the code is changed, the checksum has to be adjusted and thus the signature has to be redone as well
  \item lp does not have the developers signature
  \item detect if signature is changed (app is very likely to be altered then) and do not allow to run
  \item similar thing does google with their maps license
\end{itemize}
