\subsubsection{Debuggability} \label{subsection:section:counter-improve-tampering-debuggable}
Enabling debugging allows the developer to use aditional features for analysing the app at runtime, like printing out logs \cite{androidDebugging}.
This features are used to gain information about the flow of the app and to reenginer functionality.
With the results of this analysis weak points are identified and custom patches are developed.
\newline
The debug flag is not set in release builds on the application stores, but it can be activated by chaning it in the \textit{classes.dex}.
In order to prevent attackers taking advantage from this possiblity, the developer should check whether this flag is activated und thus the application is tampered.

Code snippet~\ref{codeSnippet:tamperingDebuggable} is an example for an implementation of this check.
The debug flag can be aquired from the application information as seen in line 15.
In case the debug is set, and thus the application is tampered, the process is killed in line 18.
