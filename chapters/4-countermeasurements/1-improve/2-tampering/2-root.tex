\subsubsection{Root} \label{subsection:counter-improve-tampering-root}
\textit{Root} can be used to alter applications or extract protected data.
The developer can check whether \textit{root} is available on the device and eventually exclude these devices from running the application.
The developer needs to communicate to the users the reasons for this strict policy, since there are a lot of users who use root for other reasons than cracking applications.

Google has introduced a similar \gls{api}t, called SafetyNet \cite{safetynetGoogle}.
It is used to check the â€œhealth and safety of an Android"\cite{safetynetDev}.
It is said to be used in security critical applications like Android Pay and the reason for excluding rooted devices from the service \cite{safetynetGoogle} \cite{safetynetPay} \cite{safetynetPayx}.

Since \textit{root} is achieved by the \textit{su} file in the filesystem, the application can search for its existance in the common locations.
In case the search is successful, the execution of the application can be terminated.
