\subsubsection{Root} \label{subsection:counter-improve-tampering-root}
\textit{Root} can be used to alter applications or extract protected data.
The developer can check whether \textit{root} is available on the device and eventually exclude these devices from running the application.
The developer needs to communicate to the users the reasons for this strict policy, since there are a lot of users who use \textit{root} for other reasons than cracking applications.
Code snippet~\ref{codeSnippet:tamperingRoot} is an example implementation.

Since \textit{root} is achieved by the \textit{su} file in the filesystem, the application can search for its existance in the common locations.
In case the search is successful, the execution of the application is terminated.

Google has introduced an \gls{api} providing similar checks, called SafetyNet \cite{safetynetGoogle}.
It is used to check the \grqq health and safety of an Android\grqq\cite{safetynetDev}.
It is said to be used in security critical applications like Android Pay and the reason for excluding rooted devices from the service \cite{safetynetGoogle} \cite{safetynetPay} \cite{safetynetPayx}.
