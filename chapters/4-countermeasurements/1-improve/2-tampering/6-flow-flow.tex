\subsubsection{Flow Control} \label{subsection:counter-improve-tampering-flow}
\begin{itemize}
  \item since the code is known and can be modified, this can be used to implement functionality inside that Library by reusing methods or implementing
  calls which are only called if the right flow inside the library is done, e.g. put important method in block that is skipped when patched
  \item implement second version of LVL that is known to fail, LP will patch both, stop app when failing licensecheck is true
\end{itemize}
