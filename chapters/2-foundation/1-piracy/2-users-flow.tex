The loss of developers in the ecosystem is bad for user, but they can also be harmed by piracy.
Users use pirated applications because they seem to be free of charge, but it comes at a price.
The application might be altered in different ways, e.g. malware may be included or personal data stolen by abusing changed permissions.
The user will not notice it right away since these "features" often happen in the background without their knowledge.
The application may for instance start using an expensive service, like premium SMS, or upload the contacts to the internet.
Even if there is no malicious content implemented, the application can suffer from bad stability due to manipulated code, like removed license verification, and missing updates when related from an unofficial source.
In general, the risk is very high that pirated software has a worse user experience than the original.
Pirated software should not be installed since it cannot be ensured without deep inspection that the application is doing what it is supposed to do. \cite{bitdefenderPlagiarism}\cite{lierschDeveloperThreats}
