\subsection{Users} \label{subsection:foundation-piracy-users}
Not only the loss of developers in the ecosystem is bad for user but also pirates can harm the users.
Users use pirated applications because they seem to be free but it comes at a price.
The application might be altered in different ways, e.g. malware can be included or it steals personal data by abusing changed permissions.
The user will not notice it right away since these features often happen in the background without the knowledge of the user, e.g. send SMS using an expensive service or uploads the contacts to a database.
Even if there is no malicious content implemented, the applications can suffer from bad stability due to removed license verification and missing updates when related from an unofficial source.
In general the risk is very high that pirated software has a worse user experience than the original.
Pirated software should not be installed since it cannot be ensured without deep inspection that the application is doing what it is supposed to do. \cite{bitdefenderPlagiarism}\cite{lierschDeveloperThreats}

%when downloading pirated apk, no idea what they changed (malware, stealing data,privacy, permissions)
%wont notice any difference since in backgound
%cracking can lead to bad user experience, e.g. copied apps, mostly for paid apps

%malware creators abuse existing applications by using them as trojan horse, visually identical as the original app, but with malicious code injected
%results in bad user experience since app might not be stable and it does things it is not supposed to
%for example this can be in form of sms permission, send a lot of expensive sms in the background or upload contacts to hackers server
