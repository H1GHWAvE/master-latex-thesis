\subsection{Dangers for Users} \label{subsection:foundation-piracy-users}
The loss of developers in the ecosystem is bad for users, but they can also be harmed by piracy.
Users prefer pirated applications, they seem to be free of charge, but that's not necessarily true.
The application might be altered in different ways, e.g. malware may be included.
The user will not notice it right away, since these \textit{features} often happen in the background without their knowledge.
The application may for instance start using an expensive service, like premium SMS, or upload the contacts to the internet without the user recognizing.
Even if there is no malicious content implemented, the application can suffer from bad stability due to manipulated code and missing updates when related from an unofficial source.
In general, the risk is very high that pirated software offers a user experience worse than the original. \cite{bitdefenderPlagiarism} \cite{lierschDeveloperThreats}

Pirated software is always a risk and should not be installed since the integrity of the application cannot be ensured without deep inspection.
