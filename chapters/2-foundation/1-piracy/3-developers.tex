\subsection{Threat to Developers} \label{subsection:foundation-piracy-developers}
%START TEXT INPUT
Especially for software developers piracy is a problem.
At first glance, the problem is clear. When people are downloading an application for free and do not pay for it anymore there is no revenue generated and the developer does not earn any money. At second glance, the facts are more complex.
%START TEXT INPUT

on the first view lost revenues when the application is not bought anymore but downloaded from a blackmarket or website
on the second view the application can not only be made available without purchasing it, but it can also be modified and misused further
- the attacker can replace the developer's google ad id with his own and this way the ad revenues go to his pockets and are missing in the developers one
- disable the verification for in app sales, this way the user can buy items from the e.g. inapp store without being charged and the developer not earnign anything, or even more direct: simply activate the pro feature for application in the code

overall when the app is taken from the environment of the app store it is sold  and moved to blackmarket/website to download, the developer has no more control over it, he cannot support it with fixes and updates
when this happens or maliscious behaviour was included by the pirate, the bad reputation is on the developer
also the generated traffic cannot be predicted anymore, this traffic does not make money but costs us, double fail

and if the code is stolen in general, it can be reverse engineered,  the awesome algorithms included are lost and can be used in any way the pirate likes
