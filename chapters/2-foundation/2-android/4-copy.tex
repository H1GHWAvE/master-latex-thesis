\subsection{Original Copy Protection} \label{subsection:android-copy}
 It replaces the old system copy protection system, wherein your APKs would be put in a folder that you can't access. Unless you root. Oh, and anyone who can copy that APK off can then give it to someone else to put on their device, too. It was so weak, it was almost non-existant.\newline
 kann mit root umgangen werden
