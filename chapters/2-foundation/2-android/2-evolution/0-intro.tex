The underlying entity of the system is its kernel which bridges the hardware of the device and the remaining software components. Being a Linux-based kernel, it allows remote access to the device via a Linux shell as well as the execution of standard Unix commands.\newline
A level above is the Android Runtime, which will be explained closer\newline
At the same abstraction level as the virtual machine are the native libraries of the system. Written in C/C++, they permit low level interaction between the applications and the kernel through Java Native Interface (JNI)\newline
The next layer is the application framework which provides generic functionality to mobile software through Android’s  \gls{apig}.
The top layer of the Android OS stack is where custom applications are compiled, installed and executed.\newline
