when submitting can check amazon DRM (see picture), applay amazon DRm to "Protect your application from unauthorized use. Without DRM, your app can be used without restrictions by any user." as the description says

This signature is unique to you, does not change, and is the same for all apps in your account."  as the description says, so developer signing the application by the develoepr before submitting is not necessary, amazon decompiles apk, injects drm code, compiles it and signs it with the "amazon developer" certificate
