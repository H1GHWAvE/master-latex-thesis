\subsubsection{Functional Principle}\label{section:license-amazon-functional}
The prerequesites are the same as with the \gls{lvl}, the developer has to have an account on the Amazon platform.
Amazon has a different approach of implementing the license verification check.
Instead of the developer integrating the license verification library himself, the developer is asked when uploading the application whether it should be integrated (see figure~\ref{fig:amazon}).
The description explains it as "Protect your application from unauthorized use. Without DRM, your app can be used without restrictions by any user." \cite{amazonDeveloper}
The mechanism is applied by injecting a wrapper into the application.



different approach to perform license verification and enforce result
google lvl include and integrate modified version of lvl library, not required to implement any mechanism on their own, done by amazon packaging tool
when submitting can check amazon DRM (see picture), applay amazon DRm to "Protect your application from unauthorized use. Without DRM, your app can be used without restrictions by any user." as the description says
"As part of the ingestion process Amazon removes your developer signature and applies an Amazon signature. This signature is unique to you, does not change, and is the same for all apps in your account."  as the description says, so developer signing the application by the develoepr before submitting is not necessary, amazon decompiles apk, injects drm code, compiles it and signs it with the "amazon developer" certificate
