library probiding reventive measure against illegal repoduction
works only on samsung devices since samsung store has to be installed and logged in
inspects the license of application executed to prevent illegal use
checks for license from license server upon init and stores it on device for future offline check, timed life
also checks if license from server if stored license has been removed or damkages, license from server unique for each device/application
if app is copied to another device, application will not execute

interior process:
makes query for stored licensetest
if found, app can execute
if not exist or invalid, infromation of device and applciation will be send to server (once stored internet connection not required anymore)
if purchased for device, server returns license back to zirconia
zirconia stores license on device
return step 1
