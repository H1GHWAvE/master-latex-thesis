\subsubsection{Functional Principle} \label{section:license-samsung-functional}
\begin{itemize}
  \item same drm as other libraries
  \item works only on samsung since download requires samsung store
  \item checks license with server, unique for each device/application so copying does not work
  \item process: query for stored license, if yes: execute, if not exist or invalid send info about device and application to server (first time only), server responds, app stores, next time from begin
  \item asynch callback
  \item does not work without network or airplane if license not found, does not rely on galaxyapps like google, direct communicaiton
  \item do nto call to often since internet call is slow
\end{itemize}
