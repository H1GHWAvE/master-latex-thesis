Since the original approach of subsection~\ref{subsection:android-copyroot} was voided, another method had to be introduced.
This topic is not only relevant to Google as the main of contributor to Android and provider of its biggest store.
Since Android allows to install apps from unknown sources and not only the Google Play, other stores were created to steal a piece of Google's Android pie.
Some of the most widespread stores are from Amazon and Samsung.
Amazon does not only have the Amazon Store but is also trying to create an own ecosystem by selling the Firetablets with an Amazon tailored flavor of Android at a low price tag.
Another approach is Samsung pursuiting. In addition to a store they are also offering different services as well to bind to their ecosystem.
There are different Chinese stores as well but they are out of scope since their relevance is bound to the eastern markets.

All these stores have to fight the copy protection problem in order make their store attractive and bind developers with low piracy rates.
Since the initiative is coming from the stores, the copy protection methods are included into application itself. \cite{munteanLicense}
