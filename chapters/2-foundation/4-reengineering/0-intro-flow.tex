\begin{itemize}
  \item cracking tools alter apps by applying patch on apk, onylthing they can touch, so analyze apk
  \item static tools since code is modified, get overview how to find countermeasures
  \item different layers of abstraction, bytecode (what exactly is changed), smali (what function is changed), java (functionality changed), java problems since decompiler
  \item code dependecy, dex java isomorphic, differences
  \item overall decompilation
  \item best case get detailed overview of patching mechanism on high level, since readable, maybe low level sufficient, understand relation between change and function
  \item different tools and techniques
\end{itemize}
