most apps are installed /data/app, android restricts access, with root possible

to get installed applications on phone use android package manager
after connecting phone to computer and having \gls{adb} tools installed
adb shell \'pm list packages -f\' (1)
outputs a list of installed apps in formatf <namespace>.<appName> and an appended number "-1", each is a folder of instlaled app containing a base.apk (the application apk)
example 2 enth√§llt return von (1)

then find app which should be transfered to computer and use
adb pull /data/app/me.neutze.licensetest-1/base.apk
to download app into current folder

in case you have root you can use file manager as solid explorer to access the folder directly and copy apk to user-defined location/send per mail
