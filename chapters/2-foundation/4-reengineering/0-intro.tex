Cracking tool are modifying the application code since it contains the license verification.
In order to understand the attack, the \gls{apk}'s \textit{classes.dex} is analysed.
The goal is to identify how the exact mechanism applied to circumvent the license verification mechanism.
The acquired knowledge is later used to suggest countermeasures against cracking tools.
\newline
The code is reverse engineered on different abstraction layers to not only identify the local bytecode change but also to retrace the change in the functionality of the code.
While dex and smali code reflects the local changes, Java code is used to see the bigger picture.
The tools to retrieve the different abstractions and the way the changes are discovered will be described in the following.
