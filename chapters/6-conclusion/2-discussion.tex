clear in beginnign that lvl not sufficiently safe with current technology
unclear degree and fixavle

shortly after start insufficient reilience against reverse engineering, not explusivly to lvl
thus shift from lvl protection to general protection against reverse engineering, decompilation and patching

eternal arms race
no winning solution against all cases, jsut small pieces quantitative improvement
no qualitatively improve resilience
limited to quantitative resilience, matter of time until small steps
generate more work for reengineering, ggf lower motivation for cracker
only matter of time until patching tools catch up, completely new protection schemes need to be devised to counter those
