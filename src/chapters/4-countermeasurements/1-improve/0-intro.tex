This section proposes countermeasures building on the license verification mechanism.
\newline
The first suggestion aims to make the \gls{lvl} implementation unique as suggested by Google.
This changes the bytecode and may render some of the search patterns of \gls{luckypatcherg} useless.
\newline
The second suggestion is to get rid of the dex bytecode targeted by the automatic patching of \gls{luckypatcherg}.
\newline
The third suggestion introduces an additional layer of checks.
\newline
Finally, obfuscation is discussed to prevent future reverse engineering efforts.
