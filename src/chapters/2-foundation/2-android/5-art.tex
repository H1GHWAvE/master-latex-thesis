\subsection{ART - Android Runtime} \label{subsection:android-art}
In Android version 4.4 \textit{Kitkat} Google introduced \gls{art}, designed to replace the \gls{dvm}.
Among other things, it does away with \gls{dex} files and replaces them with native code.
This refutes all attempts to attack the reengineerable dex bytecode.
For compatibility reasons, \gls{apk}s still have to provide the \textit{classes.dex}.
With the release of version 5.0 \textit{Lollipop} \gls{art} became the runtime of choice.
Throughout the Android 6.0 \textit{Marshmallow} previews, it was constantly evolving and sometimes breaking compatibility with older versions. \cite{andevconDalvikART} \cite{androidArt}
