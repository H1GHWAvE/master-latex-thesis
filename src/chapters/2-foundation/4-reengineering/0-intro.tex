For the approach chosen, the code needs to be reverse engineered on different abstraction layers.
First, it is described how to extract \gls{apk} from the device.
Then the extraction of the \textit{classes.dex}, the conversion to smali and the reverse engineering of the Java code are shown.
Finally, the use of diff is explained.
