Android is target to massive levels of attacks, stealing intellectual property.
Huge losses occur through general attacks on license verification mechanisms.
\gls{luckypatcherg} is recognized as one of the major culprits.
The scope of this work is to understand \gls{luckypatcherg}â€™s strategy of attacks and propose countermeasures.
A black box analysis is chosen and an exhaustive test done, attacking several applications.
The strategy is made apparent and traced back to the single concept of a unary decision.
An array of countermeasures is proposed, some fortifying the current basis and others suggesting disruptive change.
All proposed solutions exist in the trade off between security, openness and complexity.
